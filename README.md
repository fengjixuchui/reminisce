# reminisce
Reminisce is a web application that is capable of simulating x86-64 assembly code in NASM syntax. 
It also provides users with useful debugging information such as the registers and the stack in real time, as it go through each assembly instruction line by line.

This project was created during the thirty six hour hackathon, HackUMass IV, so the quality of this program should be questioned before usage. :)
